[Verse]
Jumping through the puddles as the rain comes down
Laughing till our bellies ache no signs of a frown
Chasing every rainbow till the sun comes out to play
Learning all the colors in a joyful spray

[Verse 2]
Building castles in the sand with dreams in every grain
Riding on our bicycles we're racing through the lane
Counting every star that twinkles in the evening sky
In each and every moment oh we learn to fly

[Chorus]
Memories in motion with every twist and turn
Adventures in the making with every lesson learned
Dancing through the days and playing in the nights
Our hearts are full of wonder oh we're reaching new heights

[Verse 3]
Planting little gardens taking care to watch them grow
In a world of endless wonders there's so much to know
Floating paper boats on streams that carry them away
Learning all the wonders in a summer's day

[Bridge]
Every book we open every story that we share
Brings a world of magic and a life without a care
Songs we sing together every melody and rhyme
They bind us in this journey through the sands of time

[Chorus]
Memories in motion with every twist and turn
Adventures in the making with every lesson learned
Dancing through the days and playing in the nights
Our hearts are full of wonder oh we're reaching new heights

[Verse]
Vision board on the wall, Lambo doors that rise,
Grip the wheel tight, stars in my eyes,
Engine roars, future so bright,
Manifest the dream, under city lights.

[Verse 2]
Leather seats, custom stitching glow,
Speed past doubts, dreams overflow,
Tires screech, watch the envy grow,
Chasing visions, life's an endless show.

[Chorus]
Dream whip, I’m steering through the night,
Whispers of the wind, got my goals in sight,
Gas pedal blessings, never hit the brake,
Through the fog of doubt, risks I gotta take.

[Verse 3]
Night drives, skyline kissing stars,
RPMs match the beats of my heart,
Paint job glossy, destiny by design,
Skrrt skrrt, leaving all the fears behind.

[Bridge]
Fuel dreams, foot down, never looking back,
Rearview memories, roads turning black,
Life’s highway, no detours on my track,
Steering my fate, dreams never slack.

[Verse 4]
Convertible ambitions, top down, let it breeze,
Wind in my hair, brushing past the trees,
Every mile closer to what I believe,
Drive into the future, leave behind the sleaze.

[Verse]
Brilla el sol y mi paso firme va
Ruge fuerte como el mar sin parar
Reto al viento soy un huracán
En mi piel llevo fuego y hurto el pan

[Chorus]
Soy seguro inquebrantable
Con mi fuerza inigualable
Todo puedo conquistar
Nada me podrá frenar

[Verse]
Miran todos ya no pueden dudar
Caminando nadie me vencerá
Soy relámpago en la tempestad
El destino en mis manos está

[Chorus]
Soy seguro inquebrantable
Con mi fuerza inigualable
Todo puedo conquistar
Nada me podrá frenar

[Bridge]
No hay límites que se interpongan
Ni montañas que se opongan
Soy un ángel y guerrero
Con el universo entero

[Chorus]
Soy seguro inquebrantable
Con mi fuerza inigualable
Todo puedo conquistar
Nada me podrá frenar

[Verse]
Woke up in the morning light
Dreams are brighter dreams in sight
No more worries no more fight
따라와 ready for flight

[Chorus]
I am free 나는 풍요를 만들어요
Breaking chains watch the glow
I am free 나는 꿈을 펼쳐요
Feel the beat let it flow

[Verse 2]
Counting stars in the midnight sky
Money tree growing high
Opportunities flyin' by
놓치지 마 그리 높이 가

[Chorus]
I am free 나는 풍요를 만들어요
Breaking chains watch the glow
I am free 나는 꿈을 펼쳐요
Feel the beat let it flow

[Bridge]
Steppin' up never lookin' back
Filling life with what we lack
나는 강해 날아가
Hold my hand 새빛나

[Chorus]
I am free 나는 풍요를 만들어요
Breaking chains watch the glow
I am free 나는 꿈을 펼쳐요
Feel the beat let it flow

[Verse]
Dust off the shoulders, heavyweight soldier
Heart like boulders, world gettin' colder
Step through the struggle, hustlin' jumble
Fell nine times, tenth time rubble

[Chorus]
Keep it movin', never losin'
Findin' light in all confusion
Challenges turnin', I'm learnin'
Power in the fire, keep it burnin'

[Verse 2]
Crumblin' pressure, but I measure up
Champ with the belt, ain't no runner-up
Storms bring the thunder, I ain't hidin' under
Phoenix from the ashes, rises stronger

[Bridge]
Brick by brick, buildin' this empire
Doubt fuels the flame, feeds my fire
Turn the pain to gain, break the chain
Mind over matter, fight through the rain

[Verse 3]
Life's full of tests, I ace 'em all
Standin' tall in the face of my fall
Resilient spirit, hear it, feel it
Every hit taken, bars reveal it

[Chorus]
Keep it movin', never losin'
Findin' light in all confusion
Challenges turnin', I'm learnin'
Power in the fire, keep it burnin'
